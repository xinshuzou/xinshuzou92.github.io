<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


I graduated with a Bachelor degree in Material Science and Engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2015; then took a joint Master program in Optical Engineering from the China Academy of Engineering Physics and the University of Science and Technology of China in the next 3 years. During 2018‚Äì2022, I worked as a PhD candidate in the School of Material Science and Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. After that, I moved to work as a PhD researcher in the Department of Structural Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

I am proficient in the operation of equipment utilized in the characterization of structures and properties in my research, including STEM, HRTEM, SEM, XRD, FT-IR, Raman, AFM, UV-vis-NIR, FIB, and the analysis of TEM, STEM, and SEM images of nanomaterials. I am skilled in integrating the understanding of nanomaterials' properties with their nanostructure at the atomic level.

My current research interests include the development and evaluation of anti-hydrate and anti-icing surfaces with both deposition-suppressing and super-low adhesion properties. I have published more than 16 co-authored papers in international journals.
